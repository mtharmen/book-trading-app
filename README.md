# Free Code Camp Challenge: [Build a Book Trading App](https://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/manage-a-book-trading-club)

## User stories:
1. I can view all books posted by every user.
2. I can add a new book.
3. I can update my settings to store my full name, city, and state.
4. I can propose a trade and wait for the other user to accept the trade.

## Possible Updates:
1. Maybe surface the users location after a trade is accepted. Left out for now because this is a demo
2. Ability to search by author or ISBN
