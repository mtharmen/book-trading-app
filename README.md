# Free Code Camp Challenge: [Build a Book Trading App](https://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/manage-a-book-trading-club)

## User stories:
1. I can view all books posted by every user.
2. I can add a new book.
3. I can update my settings to store my full name, city, and state.
4. I can propose a trade and wait for the other user to accept the trade.

## Possible Updates:
1. Better way to handle book arrival confirmation
2. Only show completed offers from the past 30 days with an option to see all past offers
3. Notifications for new incoming offers and responses to outgoing offers
